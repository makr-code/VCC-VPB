    "content": "Based on the provided diagram, here are some concrete suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify Gateway G1**: The gateway is currently used to make a decision based on the outcome of Vollständigkeit prüfen (F2). Consider replacing it with an OR_CONNECTOR and connecting F3 (Nachforderung Unterlagen) and F4 (Sachprüfung) directly to G1.\n2. **Add a COMPETENCY_CHECK**: Since Sachbearbeitung is responsible for Vollständigkeit prüfen (F2), consider adding a COMPETENCY_CHECK before F2 to ensure that the task is assigned to the correct person.\n3. **Improve the decision-making process**: The current diagram seems to imply that if the application is incomplete, it will be rejected. Consider adding an OR_CONNECTOR between G1 and F6 (Bescheid (Ablehnung)) to allow for alternative decisions.\n4. **Add a LEGAL_CHECKPOINT**: Since there are legal references mentioned in some elements (e.g., § 35 VwVfG), consider adding a LEGAL_CHECKPOINT to ensure that the process complies with relevant laws and regulations.\n5. **Simplify the End Events**: The two end events E1 and E2 seem to be identical, except for their descriptions. Consider merging them into a single END_EVENT with different outcomes (e.g., \"Bewilligung\" and \"Ablehnung\").\n6. **Consider adding more GEO_CONTEXT elements**: Since some elements have geo-references, consider adding more GEO_CONTEXT elements to provide more context about the geographical aspects of the process.\n\nThese suggestions aim to improve the clarity, simplicity, and effectiveness of the diagram while maintaining its original structure and intent."
