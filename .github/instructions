Project: VCC-VPB (Processing Backend)
Language: Python

Purpose:
- High-performance data processing, ETL pipelines and batch jobs.

What Copilot should help with:
- Propose efficient data transformations, parallelization strategies and pipeline orchestration.
- Suggest improvements for memory and CPU optimization, and clear batching semantics.

Coding style and constraints:
- Prefer streaming and chunked processing for large data. Document memory/CPU expectations in `docs/`.

Documentation duties (./docs):
- Maintain `docs/pipelines.md` with pipeline diagrams and runtime requirements.

Todo.md continuation:
- Add measurable tasks (e.g., "[ ] Optimize pipeline X to process N records/s — @perf-team").

Examples for Copilot prompts:
- "Write a multiprocessing ETL worker that processes files in parallel and updates status in DB."

Testing & CI:
- Include performance benchmarks and regression checks for throughput.
